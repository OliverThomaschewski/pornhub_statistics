# PornHub Dataset for Statistics class in Summer Semester 2021

The assignment was to find any dataset and do an analysis of it.
The results show how the video length and the status (premium or not) have impact on the revenue per video.
As mentioned in the presentation, i used the raw dataset without any cleaning.

The Dataset was to big to upload to GitHub but can be found here:
